Most of my commits are private because they are related to my academic or commercial work.

### Past Academic Projects:

- **[Masters Thesis: Machine Learning and Differential Equations](https://github.com/DarrahK/MMath)**

	 - Reproducing results from the [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf) paper of generative latent function for time-series models in TensorFlow and investigated the ability of fitting and extrapolation of time series data of latent ODE models.

- **Research Project: Optimised PDE Solver**

	- This project focused on predicting coefficients for exponential splitting to numerically solve initial value problems in PDEs where free parameters appear. I aim to achieve this by training a deep neural network on optimal parameters for synthetically generating setups.
