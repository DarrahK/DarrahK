### Current Academic Projects:

- **Masters Dissertation: Machine Learning and Differential Equations**

	 - Reproducing results from the [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf) paper of generative latent function for time-series models in TensorFlow. I intend to investigate the ability of fitting and extrapolation of time series data of latent ODE models to pacemakers.

- **Research Project: Optimised PDE Solver**

	- This project focused on predicting coefficients for exponential splitting to numerically solve initial value problems in PDEs where free parameters appear. I aim to achieve this by training a deep neural network on optimal parameters for synthetically generating setups.
